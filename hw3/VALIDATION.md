# Assignment Validation Report

## Overview
This document verifies that our implementation of the distributed system model with logical clocks meets all requirements specified in the assignment. It details test results, observed behaviors, and key findings from our experimental data.

## Key Requirements Verification

### 1. Virtual Machine Implementation
- ✅ **Multiple Virtual Machines**: Successfully implemented 3 independent VMs that operate autonomously.
- ✅ **Variable Clock Rates**: Each VM has a randomly assigned clock rate between 1-6 ticks/second.
- ✅ **Message Queue**: Each VM maintains a FIFO queue for incoming messages.
- ✅ **Logical Clocks**: Properly implemented according to specifications, incrementing based on internal events and message reception.

### 2. Network Implementation
- ✅ **Bidirectional Communication**: Fixed a critical issue where Machine 1 (lowest port) was not receiving messages. Now all machines can send and receive messages with any other machine.
- ✅ **Socket Communication**: Successfully implemented reliable communication between VMs using sockets.
- ✅ **Message Ordering**: Messages are processed in the order they are received (FIFO).

### 3. Event Processing
- ✅ **Internal Events**: VMs correctly increment their logical clock for internal events.
- ✅ **Send Events**: When a VM sends a message, it includes its logical clock value.
- ✅ **Receive Events**: When a VM receives a message, it updates its logical clock to max(local, received) + 1.
- ✅ **Random Event Generation**: The system correctly generates randomized events (internal, send to one machine, send to all machines).

### 4. Logging
- ✅ **Comprehensive Logging**: All events (internal, send, receive) are properly logged with timestamps and relevant information.
- ✅ **Queue Lengths**: The logs include queue length information for analysis.
- ✅ **Clock Values**: Logical clock values are tracked in the logs.

### 5. Experimental Implementation
- ✅ **Experiment 1**: Successfully implemented to run multiple simulations and log results.
- ✅ **Experiment 2**: Successfully implemented to test different configurations (clock rates, event probabilities).
- ✅ **Analysis Tools**: Implemented thorough analysis of logs, including clock jumps, queue lengths, and event distributions.

## Bug Fix: Bidirectional Communication
We identified and fixed a critical issue where Machine 1 (with the lowest port number) was unable to receive messages. The problem was in the `connect_to_peers` method:

```python
# Original problematic code
if peer_port > self.port:  # Only connect to higher port numbers
    # Connection code...
```

This condition prevented higher-numbered machines from establishing connections to lower-numbered ones. We removed this restriction:

```python
# Fixed code
for peer_port in self.peer_ports:
    # Connect to all peers regardless of port number
    # Connection code...
```

After this fix, we verified that all machines can communicate bidirectionally:
- Machine 1 now receives messages from both Machine 2 and Machine 3
- Queue data is now properly collected for all machines
- The analysis is now more accurate and complete

## Experimental Findings

### Clock Rate Variations
- Different clock rates lead to varying event processing speeds among machines
- Slower machines tend to have longer message queues
- When machine speeds are more similar, there is less queue buildup

### Logical Clock Jumps
- Jumps in logical clock values occur when processing messages from faster machines
- The largest jumps typically happen in the slowest machines
- System demonstrates expected Lamport clock behavior

### Message Queue Analysis
- Queue lengths depend primarily on the relative speeds of the machines
- Faster machines have shorter queues as they process messages more quickly
- The fixed implementation now shows queue data for all machines, allowing for complete analysis

## Testing and Validation
- Created a comprehensive test suite validating all key components
- Verified bidirectional communication between all machines
- Confirmed proper logical clock updates for all event types
- Validated message queue processing

## Conclusion
The implementation successfully meets all the requirements specified in the assignment. The bidirectional communication fix ensures that all machines can fully participate in the distributed system, providing accurate data for analysis. The implementation provides valuable insights into the behavior of logical clocks in a distributed environment with varying processing speeds.
